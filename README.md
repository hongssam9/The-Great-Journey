### About

A fun and entertaining tower defense game! Waves of enemies will come out from the right and will attempt to reach the end to lower the user's health. Place towers around the board to prevent the enemies from reaching the end. Try to get as far as you can!

### Description

The Great Journey is a tower defense game made by a small dev team of 4. It is a partially working full stack program, where the backend needs some work whereas the frontend is operating smoothly, using React.js (Canvas) and Django.

### Background
The original design and functionality of the game is described in this repo https://github.com/hongssam9/hAPI-tower-frontend. However, I wanted a game that was a bit more simple and easier to track as well as entertaining. So, after the project concluded, I decided to make my version and implemented a Halo theme as well as making more enemies, smaller map, and entertaining visuals.
